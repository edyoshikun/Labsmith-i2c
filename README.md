# labsmith_I2C
## Description:
Labsmith microfluidic valve and pump control using STM32.
Basic functions for controling the SPS01 and 4VM01 valves from labsmith through I2C.
This allows for development of state machines for automation.

** Part of the functions were initially decoded as the documentation was not clear as how to interface (protocol sequence) with the devices.
